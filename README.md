# Canister Smart Contract

Canister Smart contracts that provide some of the basic functions of the dante cross chain service.

## Currently 
This is the starting work for World-Tree protocol stack implemention for ICP.

We have completed following abilities:
* Basic message protocol for ICP
* Genaral Message sending and receiving from and to ICP
* Simplest smart contract cross-chain invocation between ICP and some other chains

## Next
* Message verification algorithm for receiving messages on ICP
* Router selection algorithm for randomly selecting off-chain routers for ICP
* Router evaluation algorithm for the judgement of the off-chain routers for ICP
* Staking mechanisms for the execution of the World-Tree protocol stack on ICP
